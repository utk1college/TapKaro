# TapKaro

**TapKaro** is a Flutter-based mobile payment app inspired by platforms like PhonePe and Paytm. This was a **team project**, and I was responsible for building the **frontend UI** using Flutter and Dart.

## 👨‍💻 My Role: Frontend Developer

I contributed exclusively to the **frontend UI**, focusing on mobile design, layout, and navigation.  
Here's what I built:

- Designed and implemented **responsive UI screens** using Flutter (e.g., Home, Transactions, Send/Receive).
- Focused on clean, user-friendly layouts and real-world app aesthetics.
- Used **Flutter widgets**, custom styling, and proper structuring to ensure reusability and scalability.
- Coordinated with team members to align UI with backend functionality.

I did **not** work on backend logic or database integration — those were handled by other team members.
